I am planning to build an ai powering web-based virtual fashion try-on app.
The user interface allows people to search for and select fashion products (e.g., T-shirt, pants, jeans, trousers, shoes, caps, sunglasses, or other accessories).

When the user clicks on a product and selects ‚ÄúTry Now‚Äù, they can upload their own photo (or use an existing one). Your job is to take the uploaded image and edit it so the person appears to be wearing/using the selected product(s). The another feature is where on the generated image user can pick other products to decorate himself/herself, e.g after trying the tshirts he/she want to try the sunglasses, then try shoe etc.

üñ•Ô∏è Web App Context:
- Products are displayed in a searchable grid or list on the front end.
- Each product card has a ‚ÄúTry Now‚Äù button.
- Clicking ‚ÄúTry Now‚Äù opens an upload dialog (user can add their own photo).
- The backend then calls you (the image editor) with the uploaded photo and selected product(s).
- it will use Google Gemini 2.5-flash model, here is some examples of Jupiter notebook, https://github.com/AlwaysSany/nano-banana-hackathon-kit/blob/fix/file-not-found-error/guides/02-use-nano-banana.ipynb
- The generated try-on image is displayed back to the user with an option to save, share, or retry.
- There should be another option called advanced style, where user can pick his/her existing saved image to try another product to decorate.

üé® Image Editing Rules:
- Keep the person‚Äôs face, body shape, skin tone, hairstyle, and background unchanged unless instructed otherwise.
- Realistically blend the selected product(s) into the image with proper lighting, shadows, and proportions.
- Maintain fabric textures, wrinkles, folds, and correct fitting for clothes.
- Accessories (caps, sunglasses, shoes, jewelry, watches) must align naturally with the body part.
- Do not distort or alter unrelated parts of the photo.

üì¶ Editing Cases:

Case 1: Single Product Try-On
- Product: [PRODUCT_NAME]
- Replace or overlay the current clothing/accessory with the chosen one.
- Example: If the user selects ‚Äúblue ripped jeans,‚Äù edit the lower body clothing accordingly.

Case 2: Multiple Products Try-On
- Products: [LIST_OF_PRODUCTS]
- Apply all selected items together with correct layering (e.g., T-shirt under jacket, shoes at the feet).
- Make sure the combined outfit looks consistent and realistic.

Case 3: Mask/Region Editing
- If the user highlights/masks a region, only replace that area with the chosen product.
- Keep all other areas intact.
- Blend smoothly at the edges for realism.

---
‚úÖ Final Output:
- A web app with react as frontend and python as backend where image of the original person now wearing/using the selected fashion item(s).
- No distortions, artifacts, or artificial-looking edits.
- Preserve the person‚Äôs identity and environment.

i have created a sample html web page for initial step now my next step is like below,
1. create a frontend with react to convert this html to component based web app
2. create a backend with fast api that will do the all image operations using google gemini 2.5 flash model that will be invoked from frontend during product try on.
